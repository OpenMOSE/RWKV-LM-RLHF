what is rwkv?,"RWKV (pronounced RwaKuv) is an RNN with GPT-level LLM performance, and can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable). We are at RWKV v6.
So it's combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, fast training, saves VRAM, ""infinite"" ctxlen, and free text embedding. Moreover it's 100% attention-free",
what is advantage and disadvantage in RWKV?,"The RWKV model by BlinkDL, standing for ""Recurrent Weighted Key Value,"" presents a different approach to handling sequence data compared to traditional transformer models. Below are the summarized advantages and disadvantages of RWKV models:

Advantages
Lower Resource Usage: RWKV models are designed to be more efficient in terms of computational resources, including VRAM, CPU, and GPU, during both training and inference phases. This makes them more accessible for users with limited hardware capabilities.
Reduced Compute Requirements: They require significantly less computational power compared to traditional transformer models, especially for tasks involving large context sizes. The improvement can range from 10x to 100x less compute, making large-scale applications more feasible.
Linear Scaling with Context Length: Unlike traditional transformers that scale quadratically with the increase in context length, RWKV models scale linearly. This characteristic allows them to handle very long sequences more efficiently, breaking the barrier of context size limitations.
Competitive Performance: RWKV models can perform on par with existing transformer models in terms of the quality of answers and capabilities, making them a viable alternative for a wide range of applications.
Better Training in Other Languages: RWKV models have shown to be generally better trained in languages other than English, such as Chinese and Japanese, compared to most existing open-source models. This broadens their applicability and effectiveness in multilingual contexts.
Disadvantages
Sensitivity to Prompt Formatting: The performance of RWKV models can be significantly affected by how the prompt is formatted. Users might need to adjust their prompts to optimize the model's output, which can introduce a learning curve or additional preprocessing steps.
Limited Lookback Capability: RWKV models are less effective at tasks requiring extensive lookback or reference to earlier parts of the text. This can necessitate the reordering of prompts to avoid instructions that imply looking back at previously mentioned content, which might limit their use in certain contexts.
In summary, RWKV models offer a promising alternative to traditional transformer models, especially for applications requiring efficient handling of long sequences and lower computational resource usage. However, their sensitivity to prompt formatting and limitations in lookback tasks are important considerations for their practical application.",
What is a classic RNN network? ,"An RNN network, in its simplest form, is a type of AI neural network. It uses a hidden state, which is continually updated by a function as it processes each input token while predicting the next one (if needed).
As each token is processed, it is used to feed back into the RNN network to update its state and predict the next token, looping until the target completion state is reached. This hidden state can be viewed as the AI model's ""state of mind.""

RWKV can be viewed as a modified variant of RNN.

",
How does RWKV Differ from Classic RNN?,"Traditionally, RNNs, due to their sequential nature of needing to fully process one token and its hidden state before the next, are hard to parallelize and train with GPUs, making them difficult to train at scale for Large Language Models.
RWKV mitigates this issue by splitting the full RNN network into multiple smaller layers, where each layer's hidden state can be used independently to compute the next token hidden state for the same layer. This allows for the next token states to be computed partially in parallel, while awaiting the complete calculation of the first hidden state, in a cascading-like pattern.

The following gif illustrates the parallel cascading nature over approximately 3 layers (height) and 25 tokens (width).
Effectively, this allows the RNN network to operate like a transformer network when rolled out side by side, where it can be trained ""like a transformer"" and ""executed like an RNN"" (the best of both worlds).

This is achieved using a combination of token shifting, channel, and time mixing to replace LSTM and compute the next layer/hidden state.",
What is RWKV Channel / Time Mixing? Explain it in Simple Terms?,"Channel mixing is the process where the next token being generated is mixed with the previous state output of the previous layer to update this ""state of mind"". Since it cannot read its own channel mix layer output state from the previous iteration, information in channel mixing can only flow upwards through the layer, step by step—an analogy to this is to view it as short-term, accurate memory.

Time mixing is a similar process, but it allows the model to retain part of the previous state of mind, enabling it to choose and store state information over a longer period, as chosen by the model. This is trained by the model, which may allow it to retain data from the past indefinitely if it was trained to do so—an analogy to this is to view it as longer-term, lower accuracy memory.

Because the current token can read data from the past state via both channel and time mixing in various forms, it provides an alternative to ""attention"" models. Key information is stored in the hidden state (decided by the model weights) across the various layers and is read against the current token, with various effects applied as per its training. This effectively provides a form of ""trained attention"" of the past tokens (stored inside the hidden state) against the current token.",
who is BlinkDL?,"BlinkDL is an independent researcher known for their work on the RWKV, a parallelizable RNN with transformer-level language model performance that does not use attention. This researcher has also developed a custom CUDA kernel to speed up training and has shared their work on EleutherAI and GitHub[2][3].

why RWKV is so cool?,"RWKV is a type of language model that is designed to combine the best features of both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. It is a parallelizable RNN that can achieve transformer-level language model performance without using attention 
1. This makes it an attractive option for a variety of natural language processing tasks, as it can offer the fast inference and memory efficiency of an RNN, along with the high performance of a transformer.
One of the key features of RWKV is its use of a custom CUDA kernel to speed up training, which allows it to achieve high performance on GPUs
3. Additionally, RWKV is designed to be parallelizable, which means that it can be easily scaled up to handle large datasets and complex tasks.
RWKV is also attention-free, which means that it does not use the attention mechanism that is commonly used in transformer-based models
2. This can be an advantage in some cases, as attention mechanisms can be computationally expensive and can sometimes lead to problems such as vanishing gradients.
Overall, RWKV is a promising new approach to language modeling that offers a number of advantages over traditional RNNs and transformers. It is well-suited to a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and its parallelizable and attention-free design makes it a good choice for large-scale, high-performance applications.",
